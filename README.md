# Skiing-Visualization
## Nitty-Gritty
- Data Visualization project for CS 439 @Purdue_University
- Using 2022 ski resort dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/ski-resorts
## Project Overview
Multi-attribute analysis using interactive mapping and dynamic stacked bar charts. All of it is boiled down into a fairly intuitive tool that allows the user to parse through the dataset to sort ski resorts based upon attributes that they deem important. Includes a brief with a few visualizations at the beginning that includes project rationale (beyond just being assigned university work).
## Technical
- Python and JS
- Bokeh visualizations and server
- TBD
